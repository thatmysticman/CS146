# HW 10

## Problem
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-1000 <= TreeNode value <= 1000`

## High-Level Approaches

### Python Approach

1. Initialize `result` as an empty list to store the level order traversal, and `queue` as a deque containing the root node initially.
2. Start a while loop to traverse the tree level by level. At each iteration, process nodes at the current level.
3. Within the loop, determine the size of the current level by finding the length of the queue. Then, iterate over each node in the current level.
4. For each node, check if its value falls within the given range [-1000, 1000]. If it doesn't, raise a ValueError.
5. Append the value of the current node to the list `level_nodes`.
6. If the current node has left or right children, append them to the queue for further processing in the next level. Increment `nodeCount` for each added node.
7. After processing all nodes in the current level, append the list `level_nodes` containing the values of nodes in that level to the `result`.
8. After each level is processed, check if the total number of nodes processed (`nodeCount`) exceeds the limit of 2000. If it does, raise a ValueError.
9. Finally, return the `result` containing the level order traversal.

### Java Approach

1. Initialize `result` as an empty list to store the level order traversal. If the root is null, return null immediately.
2. Create a queue (implemented as LinkedList in Java) and enqueue the root node.
3. Start a while loop until the queue is empty. Within the loop, process nodes at each level.
4. At each iteration, find the size of the current level by getting the size of the queue.
5. Iterate over each node in the current level.
6. For each node, check if its value falls within the range [-1000, 1000]. If it doesn't, throw an IllegalArgumentException.
7. Add the value of the current node to the list `levelNodes`.
8. If the current node has left or right children, enqueue them for further processing in the next level. Increment `nodeCount` for each added node.
9. After processing all nodes in the current level, add the list `levelNodes` containing the values of nodes in that level to the `result`.
10. After each level is processed, check if the total number of nodes processed (`nodeCount`) exceeds the limit of 2000. If it does, throw an IllegalArgumentException.
11. Finally, return the `result` containing the level order traversal.
